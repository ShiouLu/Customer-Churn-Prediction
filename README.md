Developing a rolling-window churn prediction system with Python and SQLite


# Objective
▪︎ To Create and evaluate a churn prediction system so that each week the retailer can predict customers who are likely to churn and take preventive action.

# Dataset
▪︎ Transactional database in Sqlite

▪︎ The database contains 64,228 transaction records of 5,359 customers in six months

▪︎ With preceding research, thecustomer churn is defined as "31 days of inactivity" 



# What's included in the project
▪︎ Extract data from `sqlite3` 

▪︎ Feature Engineering including building a time-series dataframe in `sqlite3` and storing the results in Python`pandas` 

▪︎ Investigation of Feature Corrlation using Python `seaborn` `heatmap` 

▪︎ Data Standardization

▪︎ Building Machine learning models:  `svc`,  `random foreast`

▪︎ Parameter tuning & Model Evaluation with `Pipeline`

▪︎ Model deployment & Prediction

▪︎ Customer Pen Portraits
